## Design and development of MEMORY-GAME

Please try to use all concepts and topics that have learned so far. Random functions, animations, arrays, loops and conditions and any other techniques that makes the program more adjustable.

### How this program should work?

As you see in the following picture, this is a memory game. Therefore when the program loaded in the browser and user clicks on the play button,

- Timer should start counting the time
- When user clicks on white diamonds then the picture should spin and display hidden logo (picture) to the user.
- By clicking on second diamond if it is the same as first selected diamond they should display the logos and locked down in that status. but if they are not the same, they should spin-out to their original position after 1sec.
- Finding each correct pair of logos has 12.5 points for the user
- Four consecutive mistakes should reset the points to zero.
- Game content should be responsive

Note: Some example logos are in img directory of project.
GoodLuck!
